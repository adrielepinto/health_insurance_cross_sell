# BUSINESS PROBLEM
Insurance All is a company that offer health insurance services, and the product team is analyzing the possibility of offering policyholders a new product: Automobile Insurance. However, the business team needs to Know which customers would be interested in buying the new product with follow facts:
- The company has a list of 380.000 of posssible interested customers;
- The company has the capacity to make only 20.000 calls by period campaign.
- The product team selected 127,000 new customers who did not respond to the survey to participate in a campaign.

# Solution:

Use Machine Learning algorithm to sort a list priorizing the most interested customers, that can be seen by Google Sheets;

# Assumptions

# Attribute List
- Id: unique customer identifier.
- Gender: Gender of the customer.
- Age: customer's age.
- Driving License: 0, the client isn't allowed to drive and 1, the client has to drive.
- Region Code: Customer's region code.
- Previously Insured: 0, the customer doesn't have auto insurance and 1, the customer already has auto insurance.
- Vehicle Age: vehicle age.
- Vehicle Damage: 0, customer has never had his vehicle damaged in the past and 1, customer has had his vehicle damaged in the past.
- Annual Premium: amount the customer paid the company for annual health insurance.
- Policy sales channel: anonymous code for the customer contact channel.
- Vintage: number of days that the customer was associated with the company through the purchase of health insurance.
- Response: 0, the customer isn't interested and 1, the customer is interested.

# Solution Strategy

The method used for the project was CRISP-DM, apply as the steps below:

Step 01. Data Description: The goal is to use statistical metrics to identify outliers in the business scope and also analyze basic statistical metrics such as: mean, median, maximum, minimum, range, skew, curtosis and standard deviation.

Step 02. Feature Engineering: The goal of this step is to obtain new attributes based on the original variables, in order to better describe the phenomenon to be modeled.

Step 03. Data Filtering: The goal of this step it to filter rows and delete columns that are not relevant for the model or are not part of the business scope.

Step 04. Exploratory Data Analysis: The goal of this step is to explore the data to find insights and better understand the impact of variables on model learning.

Step 05. Data Preparation: The goal of this step is to prepare the data prepare data for application of the machine learning model.

Step 06. Feature Selection: The goal of this step is to select the better attributes to train the model. 

Step 07. Machine Learning Modeling: The goal of this step is to do the machine learning model training.

Step 08. Hyperparameter Fine Tunning: The goal of this step is to choose the best values for each of the parameters of the model selected in the previous step.

Step 09. Convert model performance to business values: The goal of this step is to convert model performance to a business result.

Step 10. Deploy Model to Production: The goal of this step is to publish the model in a cloud environment so that other people or services can use the results to improve the business decision. The cloud application platform choosed was Heroku.

Step 11. Telegram Bot: The goal of this step is to create a bot on the telegram app, that make possible to consult the forecast at any time.

- Bellow 1 year = 0.07% of  interested customers.
- Between 1 and 2 yars = 13% of interested customers.
- Over years = 2.80% of interested customers.
