### 5.1 Step 01 - Data Extraction 
-  Extract data from a database on AWS Cloud with PostgresSQL via Python.
  
### 5.2 Step 02 - Data Cleaning
Fix or remove incorrect, corrupted, incorrectly formatted, duplicate, or incomplete data within a dataset. 
- Understand the meaning of each attribute;
- Check the size of the data;
- Rename columns;
- Identify and treat null and duplicate data;
- Analyze and ensure correct data types;
- Apply descriptive statistics to analyze attributes;
- Identify and treat outlier data;

### 5.3 Step 03 - Exploratory Data  
Analyze and understand data. 

The objective is to understand the variables/attributes that impact the phenomenon (target) of analysis and generate business insights.This step involves Feature Engineering, Variable Filtering and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

#### 5.3.1 Feature Engineering
- Create the hypothesis map;
-  Create the Hyphotesis;
-  Validate the hyphotesis;

#### 5.3.2 Variable Filtering
Here the objective is to define attributes and their values according to a real business scenario and of interest for analyzing the phenomenon.

#### 5.3.3  Exploratory Data Analysis  (EDA):
 It consists of measuring the impact of features/attributes on the response variable (phenomenon being evaluated).

- Perform univariate analysis to understand the distribution of data for each attribute;
- Perform bivariate analysis, to validate hypotheses, generate insights by understanding the impact of attributes on the analysis of the phenomenon;
- Create a summary table of the results of the hypotheses, and the estimated relevance of the attributes for model learning;
- Perform multivariate analysis, to visualize linearly dependent columns through correlation analysis.

 ###  5.4 Step 04. Data Modeling

The objective is to prepare the data to teach Machine Learning algorithms the patterns, involving Data Preparation and Feature Selection of a Data Science project.

#### 5.4.1 Data Preparation:

The objective is to ensure that the data is numerical and on the same scale to facilitate learning of the algorithms.

- Evaluate the distribution of numerical attributes to apply the appropriate form of standardization; (Normalization, Rescale)
- Apply transformations on data; (categorical and numerical variables (Encoding's), response variable, cyclical in nature)
- Apply the preparations under the validation data as well.
- 
#### 5.4.2 Feature Selection:

The objective is to select the most relevant attributes for the model.

- Exclude attributes that were transformed into others in the feature engineering and data preparation stages;
- Define feature selection method;
- Compare suggestions from the method used with the result of the estimated relevance of the attributes for learning made in the EDA stage;
- Define the attributes that will train the machine learning algorithms.

### 5.5 Step 05 -  Machine Learning and Assessment Algorithms:

It comprises the stages of algorithm training and parameter optimization (validation stage), evaluation of the final algorithms on never-before-seen data.

The goal is to teach machine learning algorithms with training data, so that they can learn the behavior of a phenomenon with the best parameters and then generalize them to never-before-seen examples. And thus, bring the expected business return for the required application.

- Define algorithms to be applied, from simple to more complex;
- Define performance evaluation metrics and apply them to validation data using a cross-validation method;
- Define parameter optimization strategy to detect parameters that make models perform better;
- Define best algorithm(s) and their best parameters to apply to test data and evaluate performance;
- Define an algorithm with its best parameters to put into production;
- Evaluate the performance of the final algorithm from a Machine Learning perspective.

### 5.6 Step 06 - Translation and Interpretation:

Convert machine learning model results into business metrics, that is, if the model is implemented, how effective it is in the intended task, converting it into financial values.

- Answer the business questions required under the test data;
- Evaluate the performance of the final algorithm implemented in the business context from a financial aspect (revenue, cost and profit).
### 5.7 Model in Production ( Deploy ):

The objective is to make the model results accessible to any consumer (person, cell phone, app, website, Google Sheets, Excel, any software connected to the internet that can make an API request).

-  Create a class with all the necessary methods so that the final algorithm receives the transformed production data in the same way it was trained and performs the prediction;
- Build API to put the data model and project to be accessed;
- Test the API locally;
- Publish API on cloud server;
- Test the API locally in production;
- Define and develop a tool to access/query data in production.
